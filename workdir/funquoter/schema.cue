//
//    $ cue vet kube.cue -d Object kube.yaml
//
// to verify a specific type:
//
//    $ cue vet kube.cue -d Service kube.yaml

// This explains how we tell Kubernetes objects apart.

// Label and selector policy. These constraints fulfil two purposes:
//
// 1) automatically derive standard labels as a convenience to the user,
// 2) check that the value of a namesake preexisting label is correct.
//
// In general, constraints in CUE often serve the purpose of both validation and
// generation.

	// Note: no need to declare metadata.name here, even though it is referenced
	// below. Types are typically enforced by mixing in complete schema
	// definitions that are defined separately from policy.

// Require monitoring. Note that the top-level schema only suggests
// monitoring is enabled as a default. This definition goes a bit further
// in making it a strict requirement.
//
// Style tip: put "boilerplate path" on first line and start new lines with
// path elements that are more meaningful to the aspect. In this case, the
// important part is that we are adding an annotation. The fact that these
// live in the metadata section is less relevant for the understanding.
